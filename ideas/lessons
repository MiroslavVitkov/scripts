# Root locus method
Rule 1: The closed loop poles move from the open loop poles to the open loop zeroes or to infinity.
Rule 2: The RL layes on the real axis to the left of an odd number of singularities.
Rule 3: The RL goes to infinity at 180(2k1)/(#p - #z)
Rule 4: (sum(p)  sum(z))/(#p - #z) is the central point
Rule 5: The gain at a point is mult(distances to point) / mult(distances to zeroes)
